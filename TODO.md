## List of thoughts of what could be added ?

* add event log in dockspace and log events for the editor

* maybe move all of the input info in into the properties editor and just keep the pins inside the actual node.. ?

* add nodes for things like in world hoppers i.e pick up dropped item entites within radius and allow it to be used

* add buffer nodes that can store infinite amounts of a given type.
