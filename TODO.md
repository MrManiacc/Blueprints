## List of thoughts of what could be added ?

* Fix [Issue](https://github.com/MrManiacc/Blueprints/issues/2) - TileEntity synchronization when world unloading/block breaking

* add event log in dockspace and log events for the editor

* maybe move all the input info in into the properties editor and just keep the pins inside the actual node. [_**DONE**_]

* add nodes for things like in world hoppers i.e pick up dropped item entities within a radius and allow it to be
  used. [_**DONE**_]

* add buffer nodes that can store infinite amounts of a given type.  [_**DONE**_]
